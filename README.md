Data Preparation for OkCupid Dataset - Exploring Compatibility Scores and Text Data :blue_heart: :sweat_drops:

I recently completed a comprehensive data preparation task for the OkCupid dataset, a rich source of information from the popular mobile dating app. 
OkCupid distinguishes itself by utilizing pre-computed compatibility scores, derived from optional questions users may choose to answer.

The dataset comprises 60,000 records, offering a wealth of structured information, including details such as age, gender, and orientation. 
Additionally, it contains valuable text data extracted from open-ended user descriptions, providing insights into individuals' personalities and interests.

The primary objective of this project is to delve into machine learning techniques, specifically clustering, to uncover patterns within the dataset. 
The overarching goal is to leverage the compatibility scores and textual information to develop a more nuanced understanding of user profiles.

The subsequent steps in this project involve applying machine learning algorithms for clustering profiles based on common characteristics, enabling the identification 
of user segments with similar preferences and traits.  :revolving_hearts: Furthermore, the project aims to develop a recommendation system for profile matches, enhancing the overall user experience on OkCupid.

I undertook this project as part of my coursework at Redi School of Digital Integration, where I am continuously honing my skills in data analysis and machine learning. 

Feel free to explore the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions. 
Your insights are highly appreciated.:purple_heart:
